# Bulk RNA-seq Scripts

## Description
This project contains scripts designed to streamline a bulk RNA sequecning pipeline for paired-end reads. RNA seqencing is an advancing next generation sequencing technology that provides a comprehensive view of the entire transcriptome for applications such as gene expression profiling, differential gene expression analysis and variant analysis. These scripts aim to simplify the RNA sequencing process making it easy for scientists of all levels to follow.

## Installation
Working in linux environment on Windows or Terminal in macOS. Tools such as 'emacs' are needed as a text editor and 'chmod' for changing file premissions.

Please use the scripts in the following order
- **FastQC**
- **CutAdpat** (only if necessary after assessing quality of files)
- **STAR**
- **RSeQC**
- **fatureCounts**
